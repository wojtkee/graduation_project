# Distributed pressure control system in a laboratory pneumatic installation

The purpose of the project is to create a disturbed pressure control system available in room 340 of the building of the Faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics, And Computer Science. The installation including two PLC controllers that will communicate via an industrial network. The next element will be to examine the impact of the disturbance on the quality of regulation in a system built of two tanks connected in series. In order to facilitate the configuration of the installation parameters and the preview of the results, a visualization based on the Siemens HMI operator panel will be designed.
